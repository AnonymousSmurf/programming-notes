# Transmission Control Protocol
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a communications standard that enables application programs and computing devices to exchange messages over a network. It is designed to send packets across the internet and ensure the successful delivery of data and messages over networks.

TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol and is the most widely used; For example, if you click on a link on a web page from your own computer, your browser sends TCP packets over the Internet to the server hosting the website, and that server sends TCP packets back.

These packets are assigned a number so that the receiver receives them in the correct order. TCP also checks the data that is sent, so the server also sends messages back to the sender to confirm that it has received your packets and that there are no errors in them. Is your computer getting an incorrect answer? Then the packets are sent again.

In addition to web traffic, TCP is also used for downloading and streaming video (not live).
