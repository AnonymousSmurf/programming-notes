# Micro-Frontends
Micro frontends are a new pattern where web application UIs (front ends) are composed from semi-independent fragments that can be built by different teams using different technologies. Micro-frontend architectures resemble back-end architectures where back ends are composed from semi-independent microservices.

## Module Federation
Module federation is a JavaScript architecture invented by Zack Jackson. This architecture allows the sharing of code and dependencies between two different application codebases.

The code is loaded dynamically, and if a dependency is missing, the dependency will be downloaded by the host application, which allows for less code duplication in the application.
