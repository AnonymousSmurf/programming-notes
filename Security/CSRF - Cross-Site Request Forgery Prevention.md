# Cross-Site Request Forgery Prevention
[Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf) is a type of attack that occurs when a malicious web site, email, blog, instant message, or program causes a user's web browser to perform an unwanted action on a trusted site when the user is authenticated. A CSRF attack works because browser requests automatically include all cookies including session cookies. Therefore, if the user is authenticated to the site, the site cannot distinguish between legitimate authorized requests and forged authenticated requests. This attack is thwarted when proper Authorization is used, which implies that a challenge-response mechanism is required that verifies the identity and authority of the requester.

The impact of a successful CSRF attack is limited to the capabilities exposed by the vulnerable application and privileges of the user. For example, this attack could result in a transfer of funds, changing a password, or making a purchase with the user's credentials. In effect, CSRF attacks are used by an attacker to make a target system perform a function via the victim's browser, without the victim's knowledge, at least until the unauthorized transaction has been committed.
