# Setup Guide (HERZNET):

## Installing VMWARE:
- First buy a server must be dedicated otherwise might not work.
- Select no OS for it just the emergency system will do.
- Also buy one additional IP as we need this for the router.
- Be sure to check if VMWARE Sphere is competible with your server
	- If it is not competible you can ask them to update it.
- Login the dashboard and go to your server
- Go to support and ask for an Access Window.
- Get it for the maximum time (3 hours) and pick a date that works for you.
- Next go to the access window and start it.
- Then click the disk drive icon and select the IOS file for VMWARE.
- Follow the installation and let it install.
- Go to your IP and you should see the webinterface of VMWARE.

## Setting up VMWARE:
- Go to the webinterface (your server IP) and login.
- Click on host top left, then go to actions and set click ``Enter mantiance mode``.
- Then click actions again and go to services and click enable ssh.
- Now connect to your server with ssh (credentials are the same as the webinterface).
