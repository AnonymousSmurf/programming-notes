# Deployment Strategies
## Cloud
In a cloud-based deployment model, you can migrate existing applications to the cloud, or you can design and build new applications in the cloud. 

You can build those applications on low-level infrastructure that requires your IT staff to manage them. Alternatively, you can build them by using higher-level services that reduce the `management`, `architecting`, and `scaling requirements` of the core infrastructure.

## Hybrid
In a hybrid deployment, cloud-based resources are connected to on-premises infrastructure. You can integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications.

You might want to use this approach in a number of situations. For example, you have legacy applications that are better maintained on premises, or government regulations require your business to keep certain records on premises.

## On-premises
On-premises deployment is also known as a private cloud deployment. In this model, resources are deployed on premises by using virtualization and resource management tools. Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualization technologies.
