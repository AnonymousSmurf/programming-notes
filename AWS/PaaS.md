# PaaS (Platform as a service)
This is a service that provides the foundation for developers to design apps. In its simplest sense, a third-party vendor will provide hardware and software tools to users over the Internet, and users will only need to handle the application design and development process. 

All hardware and software will be hosted by the **PaaS** service provider on its own infrastructure.
